# Description
This repository is prepare for Grace Hopper Conference workshop session: Confronting Algorithmic Bias in Artificial Intelligence. The repository contains implementation of mobilenet-ssd for face detection written in keras. The model training portion is borrowed from https://github.com/bruceyang2012/Face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd

# Required Software
## Mac
1. [Brew](https://brew.sh) - package manager for Mac

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0)

`brew install python3`

3. [Keras](https://keras.io) - high-level deep learning library for Python.
4. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - Machine learning framework which serves as backend for Keras.
5. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) - Computer vision library.
6. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) - Interactive editor to run python code

`pip3 install keras tensorflow opencv-python jupyter`

# Live Inference
The repository comes with [pre-trained model](https://github.com/vinay-h/ghc-face-detection/blob/master/models/ssd_mobilenet_face_epoch_25_loss0.0916.h5). Follow the steps to detect faces from your laptop 

1. Download the git repository to your Desktop
2. Open a terminal and run the following command:

`cd <download directory>`

`jupyter live.pynb`

A window will open and you will your face being recognized.

# Training Model
This is outside the scope of the workshop and is included for the benefit of the audience and for the fullness of the workshop. Please refer to the original GitHub repository for more information on the training: https://github.com/bruceyang2012/Face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd
